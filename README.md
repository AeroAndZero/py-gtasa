# Self-driving-car-AI-GTA_SA
This is a self driving vehicle designed using a Convolutional Neural Network (Alexnet model).
This model is inspired from Sentdex (Harrison Kinley) most of the code is copied from his repository
This code is just tweaks and minor changes in his code for learning purposes 

I am learning Machine-learning and AI development and found this project interesting 
I will use this method to test different convolutional network models 
First I will use the Alexnet model and test how the AI works and then will work on my own customized network
